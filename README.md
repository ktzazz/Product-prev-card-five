## My process

I usually start from desktop size to mobile size but this time I started from mobile and I think I found it easier the part where I got stuck was when I had to transform the vertical desing to a horizontal one. It took me a while to figure it out how to, but at the end I could finish the project and I feel great about it :), I keep learning new things and practicing the stuff I already knew about.
